# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added the user-supplied `STEAL 100 EGGS` artwork as the full-screen game cover behind the Kids/Adults selector.
- Added the user-supplied full-screen victory artwork shown immediately after the fox catches the hundredth egg.
- Removed the interim FoloToy demo menu so the standalone Egg Catcher screen appears at power-on; egg movement begins only after an `UP` or `DOWN` press.
- Added transparent mirrored hand/basket-front layers and a fixed 180 ms catch animation: the egg pauses at the opening behind the basket front for 90 ms, sinks no more than four pixels for 90 ms, and then disappears without any below-basket frame.
- Added pre-game `KIDS` and `ADULTS` choices: Kids stays slower through 100 eggs, while Adults follows the former opening pace and receives a pronounced speed increase at 70; both tracks still share one movement speed and every threshold shows `SPEED UP!`.
- Made direction presses travel through one non-blocking queue and kept the basket front above every caught egg, including simultaneous catch animations and immediate turns.

- Added the standalone Egg Catcher game: two-lane egg movement, direct two-button left/right controls, score, misses, restart flow, increasing difficulty, battery status, two distinct reference-derived wolf poses, detailed hens, chutes, houses and shrubs, and host-tested game logic.
- Restored the Egg Catcher background's original thin chutes without the duplicate overpaint, completed the wolf's missing rear foot in both poses, reduced repeated LVGL label updates, and added periodic memory/stack diagnostics plus a one-hour model stress test for restart investigation.
- Changed basket contact to latch a catch immediately, placed falling eggs behind the basket rim, and added distinct start, catch, shell-break, and game-over sounds through a non-blocking audio worker.
- Restored the wolf's missing pointed ear silhouette in both poses.
- Changed Egg Catcher difficulty to clear score tiers at 20 and 40 catches, and gave upper eggs more fall frames so they descend at roughly the same visual speed as lower eggs.
- Made an egg stay visible in front of the basket opening when contact is made, latch the catch at that moment, then sink behind the basket rim on the next frame.
- Removed a stray fragment of the reference egg that was baked into the wolf sprite above its hand.
- Added six gradual speed increases at every 15 catches and a 100-egg victory screen with a short win sound and restart prompt.
- Restored the lower button's dedicated role: hold `OK` to leave Egg Catcher for its title screen, while only `UP` and `DOWN` control the basket.
- Replaced the wolf with the user-supplied orange fox, preserving its scarf, outfit, tail, and basket in mirrored 110 × 110 pixel poses.
- Stopped caught eggs after their visible basket-contact frame so they no longer continue falling below the basket.

- Added the supplied 80-byte CW2017 profile for the specified 520 mAh cell, including content/update-flag checks, verified writes, the required restart sequence, and bounded SOC-readiness polling.

- Expanded the environment bootstrap document: added Espressif's Git service mirror (`git.espressif.com.cn`) as the preferred mainland-China route for ESP-IDF v5.5.3 and its submodules, documented submodule long-wait/timeout handling, in-place repair, and the pinned-commit shallow fetch for large submodules such as `esp32-wifi-lib`, warned about stale per-repository Jihulab `insteadOf` residue, and added the official offline release archive as a last-resort fallback (learned from `esp-mosaico/esp-mosaico-vibe`).

- Reorganized the documentation by function area with a dual entry point: the root `AGENTS.md` is now a thin router (hard constraints + task routing only) and the detailed AI workflow lives in `docs/development/ai-guide.md`; `agent-guide.md` was folded in. `docs/development/` gained a second level (`engineering/`, `ci/`, `release/`), and the `plays/` application archive and `experiences/` moved into a `docs/reference/` area with a dedicated README. Removed `docs/software-design/` (empty scaffold); folded the three `assets/{fonts,images,music}/README` leaves into the `assets/` README; flattened the six `project-completion` sub-documents into a single file; and unified each directory to a single README, eliminating every `INDEX` file and a duplicated experience index. All cross-references and bibliographic links were updated; no content was dropped.

- Removed the obsolete app/test partition at `0x700000` and its related
  bootloader, validation, and documentation requirements. The fixed protected
  `cardid` partition and its CI checks remain unchanged.
- Documented a release-title convention for multi-app releases: name tags as `v<version>-<app-name>` (e.g. `v0.1.0-voice-keychain`) so the release title carries the version and the app, and confirm the title after the release is published so a release list is scannable by app.
- Added a post-release follow-up workflow: an `issue-suggestions` skill for filing user feedback as issues against the upstream project, an `experience-pr` skill for submitting reusable development experience as a documentation PR, a `docs/experiences/` directory for per-entry experience files, and supporting `project-completion`, `file-issues`, and experience-index documents.
- Simplified the tracked repository root: moved GitHub-recognized community documents into `.github/`, moved the changelog into `docs/`, updated every reference, and added a root-document allowlist to repository checks.
- Repository-wide language policy: every maintained Markdown default `.md` file is English, Simplified Chinese uses a paired `.zh_CN.md`, and both provide language switches. Static checks reject missing peers, missing switches, and Chinese prose in English defaults.
- Phase one of the AI development workflow: streamlined task-based context routing, unified local/CI validation, added PR checks and a template, and committed the dependency lock for reproducible builds.
- PR review fixes: pinned GitHub Actions to full commit SHAs, split build/release jobs by least privilege, disabled persisted sync checkout credentials, added Feature Request and Usage Question forms, clarified private security-report fallback, and corrected stale README, CI-trigger, and branch descriptions.
- Changed commit titles, PR titles, and PR bodies from Chinese-default to English; updated the Chinese punctuation rule so it no longer applies to PR descriptions.
- Reworked `build-firmware.yml` to pass `SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults`, enable `partitions.csv`, preserve the 8 MB image header, merge a flashable `FoloToy-AI-Passport-full.bin`, publish only that artifact, and use Actions cache v5.
- Integrated upstream PR #6 to resolve PR #4 conflicts: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE, radio lifecycle, and low-power demos; a 3 MB factory partition; build/menu/configuration updates; hardware-guide coverage; and bilingual capability tables.
- Defined English imperative Conventional Commit formatting for both commits and PR titles.
- Removed stale sync-workflow template comments and generalized an irrelevant Redis TTL rule to cache components.
- Added Chinese punctuation, credential safety, and recoverable file-deletion conventions.
- Expanded source-comment requirements for functions, state, ownership, concurrency, timing, registers, and magic values.
- Removed AI execution instructions from product READMEs so they remain human-facing product and repository overviews.
- Added `docs/development/agent-guide.md` as the focused AI workflow guide.
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, and the development index for the agent guide.
- Documented why the root README path is reserved for fork owners and how GitHub README precedence supports it.
- Created `main-update` from the upstream-aligned baseline and combined the repository-structure, firmware-CI, and upstream-sync work.
- Corrected the merged documentation index, workflow path, project tree, and CI references.
- Moved CI documentation from software design to `docs/development/`.
- Moved fork-only documentation assets from `assets/docs/` to `docs/assets/`.
- Moved the upstream English/Chinese project READMEs under `docs/` and renamed the documentation catalog to `docs/INDEX.md`.
- Initialized `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Standardized the initial project README language filenames.
- Added the `docs/`, `assets/`, and `skills/` directory structure.
- Moved the upstream hardware guide into `docs/hardware-design/`.
- Standardized subdirectory README capitalization and introduced fork conventions.
- Allowed fork-owned root README and supplemental documentation content on fork `main`.
- Added and documented the fork-only supplemental-document directory.
- Moved the build CI document to its dedicated CI branch before consolidation.
- Documented clean-`main` reasons, the direct-development exception, and Actions enablement for forks.
- Split the original agent rules into contribution, development, and fork documents with a compact root index.
- Updated software-design and project README references for the new documentation structure.
- Added the documentation catalog and task-triggered routing based on the earlier repository model.
- Added bilingual contribution, code-of-conduct, security, and support documents tailored to this ESP-IDF and fork workflow.
